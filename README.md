# Multi-Servo Motor Control using Arduino Uno

This project demonstrates synchronized control of four SG90 micro servo motors using an Arduino Uno R3. 
The servo motors perform a coordinated sweep motion before moving to and holding a 90° position. The project was designed,
programmed, and validated using Tinkercad Circuits Simulation.

---

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to control multiple servo motors simultaneously using PWM signals generated
by the Arduino Uno. The simulation demonstrates synchronized motion, making it a simple example of actuator 
control commonly used in robotics applications.

## Programming Language

- C++ (Arduino)

---

## Development Tools

- Tinkercad Circuits Simulation
---

## Hardware Components

- Arduino Uno R3
- 4 × SG90 Micro Servo Motors (180°)
- Male-to-Male Jumper Wires
- USB Power Supply (Simulation)

---

## Wiring

Each SG90 servo motor has three connections:

- **Orange** → Signal (PWM)
- **Red** → 5V
- **Brown/Purple** → GND

| Servo Motor | Signal Pin | Power | Ground |
|--------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Servo 1 | D9 | 5V | GND |
| Servo 2 | D11 | 5V | GND |
| Servo 3 | D6 | 5V | GND |
| Servo 4 | D10 | 5V | GND |

All servo motors share the same 5V and GND connections from the Arduino Uno.

## Project Workflow

1. Initialize four SG90 servo motors.
2. Generate synchronized sweep motion.
3. Move all servo motors simultaneously.
4. Return all servos to the 90° position.
5. Hold the final position.
